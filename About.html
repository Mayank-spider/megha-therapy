            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <h1>Megha Lakhchaura</h1>

            <p>Hi! I’m a trauma-informed counselling psychologist and psychotherapist with over 3 years of experience, dedicated to making healing, recovery, and personal growth feel simple and accessible. I believe that every person deserves a safe space to express themselves freely, without suppression, judgment, or hesitation.</p>

            <p>I also believe that the body, mind, and soul are deeply interconnected, and that healing begins when we reconnect with our center, finding a space within where we can hold different perspectives, emotions, and experiences in balance. In my work, I practice a patient, grounded, and neutral approach, understanding that each individual carries their own unique history and worldview. My intention is to remain objective and compassionate throughout our sessions, honoring your pace, your story, and your truth.</p>

            <p>When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me weightlifting, trying new recipes, singing, cafe hopping, or dancing.</p>

            <p>I am a trauma-informed, mind–body integrated therapist working through a person-centred lens. This approach allows me to tailor each session to your unique needs.</p>

            <p>My aim is to cultivate an empathetic, compassionate, and non-judgmental space that supports meaningful, sustainable growth in your life. Together, we consciously work towards the life you want to build.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Therapy With Me?</h2>

        <p>Therapy with me is collaborative in nature, where you and I work together as a team to understand you with compassion and help you help yourself and come home to yourself.</p>

        <p>In therapy, I believe in slowing down and turning inwards to reconnect with your inner wisdom instead of overanalyzing. I integrate nervous system regulation practices so you can feel safe, grounded, and connected in your body, not just understand things intellectually.</p>

        <p>If you are looking for gentle, deep, and personalized space that honours your unique path, you’re in the right place.</p>
