                <p>Counselling supports you with a specific issue in the present, whether it’s making a decision, managing a situation, or coping with something currently weighing on you. It focuses on the here and now, helping you navigate immediate challenges with clarity and confidence.</p>
                <p>It is a commitment to pause and listen to yourself, to understand what you’re feeling beneath the surface of a moment. It offers a space to gain insight into what you need right now, without judgment or pressure.</p>
                <p>The work is present-focused and can bring moments of gentle clarity and relief, helping you let go of what is overwhelming and make choices that support your well-being in the present moment.</p>

                <h3 class="service-heading">Therapy Session</h3>
                <p>Therapy goes deeper. Together, we explore past experiences, beliefs, emotional patterns, triggers, and the ways your early life shaped your coping. It is a commitment to yourself, a space to uncover and discover parts of your personality, even the ones that feel difficult to face.</p>
                <p>Therapy also offers the chance to gain new insight into the complexities of who you are. While the process can be challenging at times, there is immense beauty in letting go of what no longer serves you and releasing what holds you back from moving forward.</p>
                <p>This work helps you understand the root causes of your experiences, creating space for deeper clarity, healing, and long-lasting change.</p>

                <h3 class="service-heading">Psycho-Somatic Session</h3>
                <p>Psycho-somatic work focuses on the mind–body connection, how emotional stress, unresolved experiences, and chronic patterns show up physically as headaches, chest tightness, fatigue, digestive issues, or body tension.</p>
                <p>These sessions help you understand the language of your body, noticing how your nervous system responds and what your symptoms may be trying to communicate.</p>
                <p>It is a commitment to reconnecting with yourself, especially if you’ve spent years feeling disconnected from your body or overwhelmed by its signals.</p>
